Hi, I'm Toby.

And ever since I was little, I have always wanted to be a Pilot...

As my websites title would suggest, I am originally from England, moved to New Zealand when I was 9 and have lived here since. 

And also, as my title suggest, I am finally, after years of high school, a Student Pilot currently studying at the International Aviation Academy of New Zealand (I called it IAANZ).

I have only just started and currently working towards my Privates Pilot Licence (PPL).

I am located in Christchurch, and the Academy is right next to the International Airport, which is fantastic.

I also won't lie, a lot of the stuff I see if photo-worthy
